## Proposal 
### Introduction
**Project Title:** CultureConnect<br><br>
Made for a community that fosters connections between international students, migrants, and locals through the platform of **food, language**, **events** and **meet-ups**. <br>

When international students/migrants move to a new area, finding new friends and socializing could be tricky. For some people, creating connections online is often easier than in real life; especially if they're new. Not only that, some people could also be locals who would like to learn about international culture but do not have the luxury of time and/or money. 

With **CultureConnect**, we aim to make socializing and learning about different cultures easier for international individuals and locals. Users are able to connect to forums broken up into **local culture** and **international culture**. 
From here, users will be able to choose which channel category they want to explore.
For example, an international student from Latin America comes to Brisbane and wants to connect with other Latin Americans living in Brisbane, but also wants to practice their English with Brisbane locals. 
This app would provide information on events, food/restaurants while enabling the international student to communicate and interact with other users to assist them in exploring Brisbane and discovering their own real world community.

### Concept 
**Idea and Rationale**<br>
The idea behind this app is simple; there has yet to be a mobile app that enables individuals and/or communities (international or local) connect with each other in terms of cultural exchange. With CultureConnect, users can choose channel categories they would like to explore such as food, language and/or events. From there, users could create as many more channels are they want under the same channel category and arrange meet-ups outside of the app. We hope this app would fill the gap in that sector while helping users to connect with their own or other cultures. 

Channel Categories:<br>
* **Food**: Users are able to interact with each other by sharing community generated recipes and the best ethnic restaurants.
* **Language**: Users can be a part of a local community forum focused on learning and practising foreign languages. 
* **Events**: Users will be notified, attend and be a part of the conversation around upcoming cultural events happening in their area.
* **Meet-Ups**: Users can add, arrange and join upcoming meet-ups based on the three channels mentioned above.

**Project Aim**<br>
To create a diverse community that fosters communication between international students, migrants and locals through the platforms of food, language and events.

**Project Audience**<br>
* International Students
* Migrants
* Locals

**How Our Idea is Different From/Improves Other Current Offerings**<br>
* [Mates at UQ](http://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/matesuq) <br>
A web portal made by The University of Queensland. It is targeted at both local and international students, but mostly on international students. Its aim is to enable these students to connect and engage with each other by joining groups, events and activities. As of today, Mates at UQ provides email subscription service for students. Students can sign up for their mailing list to stay in touch and be kept up to date with happenings in the community, events, activities and group meet-ups. Updates are sent to students every two weeks via email subscription. Mates at UQ also has a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/matesatuq/) that enables students to stay in touch with events and activities happening. There are currently five different groups/categories that students could join which include:

  * **Chat Mates**<br>
  A group that encourages students to improve their fluency in english and confidence. Whenever group meet-ups are held (usually once a week for 1 to 2 hours) students would get to have interesting discussions about cultural differences, global issues and other topics surrounding the engaging backgrounds of their group. 
  * **Language Mates**<br>
  Language Exchange Mates has been designed to provide authentic speaking opportunities for UQ students who are interested in learning, developing or sustaining non-native languages. Participants can match in pairs or small groups to help one another to improve their target languages. 
  * **Dinner Mates**<br>
  A social experience group enabling students to meet on a regular fortnightly basis to participate in a food-related activities around Brisbane.
  * **Market Mates**<br>
  A group that enables students to meet on a regular fortnightly basis to participate in market activities and festivals around Brisbane.
  * **Mature (Over 23) Mates**<br>
  A channels for mature students (23 & over) to meet, connect and network with other like-minded peers. This group has their own email subscription service and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1644603525795767/). 
  
* Our idea differs from Mates at UQ since we are planning to develop a mobile app which acts as a channel for users to explore local and international cultures - categorized into further channels such as food, language or events. CultureConnect is an all-in app consisting of separate areas for different channels that enable users to socialize without needing to subscribe to a mailing list or a third-party platform like Facebook. Hence, it would be easier for users to communicate with each other on one platform. Not only that, our primary target audience is not only limited to international students but migrants and locals. Through these ready made channel categories, users are able to generate their own content in different categories. They will also get notified every time there is a newly uploaded post that matches their interests and when there are upcoming and live events or activities happening in their area. 
  
**Areas of Social and Mobile Theory**<br>

* **Emotional Design**<br>
We want our users to experience positivity (such as pleasure, trust, secure) when they use our app. This could be curated by creating and setting a user interface that looks and feels fun, enjoyable, safe and emotionally beneficial for users. Ultimately, a deep attachment or bond between users and CultureConnect would exist. 

* **Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**<br>
Theories from CSCW will be applied in our app, such as synchronous distributed interaction (from groupware time-space matrix), awareness and collaboration. 

* **Groupware Time-Space Matrix/Collaboration Framework**<br>
  * **Synchronous Distributed Interaction**<br>
  Users could use CultureConnect at the same time in a different place. For example, instant messaging/chatting with other users in the app. 

* **Awareness**<br>
Users will be able to gain knowledge about what other users are doing in the app through forums regarding different topics/platforms they are interested in, such as events. Not to forget, users will also be notified about live and upcoming events in their area.

* **Collaboration**<br>
The rich content from CultureConnect will be mostly user-generated. This is because users can create their own channels in different channel categories, for example, food, language or events.

* **Shared Information Spaces**<br>
CultureConnect provides a shared information space for users by enabling them to collaborate in a centralized channel where they can engage in and socialize with other users with the same interests by creating or joining different channels. 

* **MoSo**<br>
CultureConnect is both mobile and social. Mobile since it's portable (and will most likely be used with mobile phones) and will also have a location feature for the events channel (where users can input location for events), hence, coordinating social activities. It is also social since it's a platform for users to engage with others users with similar interests.

**Team Principles and Processes** <br>
The team will be committed to principles that maximize potential to learn and grow, while also ensuring that a product will be delivered that will be of the highest quality that each member can output.

**Principle**<br>
The team will foster an environment where feedback can be given and received by all members.  This feedback will have to fall into the realms of: 
* Positive specific (i.e. A compliment about a specific paragraph)
* Positive general (i.e. A remark about how a team member is very attentive and receptive to the group chat)
* Negative specific (i.e. I think this sentence can be written better, and should flow like...). 

**Rationale** <br>
All feedback should be a taken as an attempt to foster team spirit and to deliver on the highest quality of product possible.  It is important to the team to specify these attributes and attitudes to feedback delivery, feedback enables us to grow and to deliver a great product, and is a powerful tool when defined with the above constraints.<br>

The team will also be committed to an environment of innovation and developing the unique talents of each individual team member. This will be achieved by allowing team members to select the work that speaks most to them, and to allow themselves to take a genuine interest in the work they are participating in, and allow development based on the investment in their choice.  In adopting this principle, we believe that this will create an environment where every member is invested in delivering the best contribution they can to the project. 

**Operational Processes** <br>
To achieve the principles we have outlined above, it is expected that all team members will follow basic courtesy and etiquette rules. <br>
 
One of them will be to allow an attitude of open feedback, it will be the responsibility of the team members to make sure that feedback delivered fits into one of the categories of: positive specific, positive general or negative specific.  The danger lies within the ‘negative general’ feedback category, this piece of feedback will likely not be specific enough to be helpful, and will likely work against fostering team spirit.  If a team member is unsure of which category the feedback falls into, they should discuss it with an unrelated team member, who can assist them in confirming it falls into one of the three acceptable categories.<br>

To foster an environment of innovation, work will be broken up into segments, dubbed as tasks. Tasks will be available for team members to choose from, with each team member required to select a specific number of tasks.  If two team members wish to select the same task, it will be solved by a coin toss.  

**Task Division** <br>
Tasks will be allocated as fairly as possible, through discussion within the group. Work will be allocated first by volunteering then via group discussion. When allocating work, deadline and standard required will be clearly defined. All members will contribute equally to the project workload. Any group members who are unsatisfied with the allocation should raise it in a group meeting. Group members are expected to do their best to deliver tasks on time, and should contact the group in advance if they anticipate being unable to do so.

**Decision Making** <br>
Decisions will be made collectively as a group ensuring every team member’s ideas are taken into account. In case of discrepancies, the decision will be based on a voting system; in the case of a any disputes in voting, we will consult with the tutors or the course coordinator to assist with any problematic decision.

**Non-Compliance**<br>
**Minor non-compliance will be defined where:**
* A team member does not abide to the document standards set out by the team. (style guide will be decided upon before tasks are designated).
* A team member does not update team-coordinating software when an update on a task’s status has been changed (i.e. not moving a task on Trello).
* A team member does not inform the team of their planned/unplanned absence in a team meeting at least 3 hours before the meeting.  (via Facebook Messenger, Slack, email, etc.)

**Major non-compliance will be defined where:**
* A team member does not respond to assessment specific communication in one day.  (If a question is asked about progress, etc.)
* A team member does not fulfil their contribution to assessment specific tasks at the due date, or a date agreed upon by all team members.
* A team member does not prioritize attendance at team meetings, and is consistently absent from team meetings.
 
**Dispute resolution** <br> 
Any group member who takes issue with the actions of another group member should raise it either with the person in question, or at a group meeting, as appropriate. If these measures are unable to resolve it, only then it should be raised, by the group, with a tutor or lecturer. See also rules for peer assessment in the course profile (email co-ordinator, group notification/meeting, peer assessment).


## Communication
### Meetings
* Our team will meet once a week on a Friday (outside our workshop session) at 5 pm at The University of Queensland.

### File Storage
* Files will be stored under a Google Drive folder, currently named 'Team Multitalented' and a Github repository named Team Multi-talented.
* All files will follow a naming convention and the structure is as follows: DocumentName_GroupName_CourseCode.FileType

### Task Management
* Trello will be used to keep fellow team members on track of the project. Tasks will be uploaded to Trello, and team members will indicate which task they are working on and when. 

### Social Platform 
* Slack: All team members are in the #teammultitalented channel, all communications and discussions will happen there. 
* Facebook: This will be the second option of communication if Slack is not working or any of the members is not responding.
* Trello: Trello will enable easy and mobile task allocations via the Trello App.

## Project Phases 
### Research 
Before actually developing an app, we need have a deep understanding of our chosen domain and idea. Our research will include the current existing similar product in order to perform a UX comparison evaluation. 	This will enable us to get an idea as to how to improve our app not only in terms of design, but the functionality for users. This research is not only limited to requirements gathering from the internet but from users via survey and low-fidelity prototyping. 

### Requirements
Below are methods in achieving requirements for our app: <br>

**Internet Research** <br>
The internet is the largest portal that enables us to research deeply about this app’s domain and idea, while allowing us to gather information about similar products. <br><br>
**User Survey** <br>
We will upload online surveys via Google Forms for our target audience; from where we can collect and analyze results in order to achieve a more specific set of requirements. <br><br>
**User Testing** <br>
User testing is vital. This is because it enables us to understand how to create an excellent user experience while also providing great usability for our users. By performing this test, we will be able to improve our user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) based on the result of test upon analyzation. 
  * Design Stage<br>
  User testing via paper prototype.  
  * Construction Stage<br>
  Scenario-based user testing. 

### Design
During the design stage, we will develop a paper prototype (low-fidelity prototype) which will then be used for user testing. From the results of the test, we will finalize our wireframes/rough mock-up designs that will be used as a guide for the actual construction of the app prototype. 

### Construction
Our app prototype will be developed using HTML, CSS JavaScript, PHP and SQL. Each feature of the app will be tested, reiterated and finalized based on user feedback from user testing.
