### Research

### Requirements
We made a ![low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/Low-Fidelity-Prototype) to test if users could understand the purpose and concept of the project. Based on the ![user testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/Usability-Testing-&-Findings), we have collated, reviewed and analyzed the results. Then, together with the results from our research that can be found ![here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-students-information-seeking) and ![here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-students-interaction-behavior-with-social-media) and surveys such as ![User Demographic Survey](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/User-Demographic-Survey) and ![International Student Survey](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-Student-Survey), we then came with a set of requirements for our prototype and created a product backlog on ![Trello](https://trello.com/b/CeRxugZ5/deco3500-culture-connect). The prototype is shown below:
