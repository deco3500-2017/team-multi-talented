## Proposal 
### Introduction
**Project Title:** MultiExchange / Culture Exchange / InterX<br><br>
A digital community that fosters and creates connections between international students, migrants, locals and travelers through the platform of **food, language** and **events**. <br>

When people move or travel to a new area, finding new friends and socializing could be tricky. For some people, creating connections online is often easier than in real life; especially if they're new to the area. Not only that, there are also locals who would like to learn about international culture but do not have the luxury of time and/or money. 

With **InterX**, we aim to make socializing and learning about international cultures easier for international individuals and locals. Users are able to connect into forums broken up into **local culture** and **international culture**. 
From here, users will be able to choose which topic (platform) they want to engage with.
For example, an international student from Latin America comes to Brisbane and wants to connect with other Latin Americans living in Brisbane, but also wants to practice their English with Brisbane locals. 
This app would provide information on events, food/restraunts, while enabling the international student to communicate and interact with other users to assist them in exploring Brisbane and discovering their own real world community.

### Concept 
**Idea and Rationale**<br>
The idea behind this app is simple; there has yet to be a mobile app that enables individuals and/or communities (international or local) connect with each other in terms of cultural exchange. We hope this app would fill the gap in that sector while helping users to connect with their own or other cultures. 

Platform Ideas:<br>
* **Food**: Users are able to interact with each other by sharing community generated recipes and their favourite ethnic restaurants.
* **Language**: Users can be a part of a local community forum focused on learning and practicing foreign languages.
* **Events**: Users will be notified, attend and be a part of the conversation around upcoming cultural events happening in their area.

**Project Aim**<br>
To create a digital community that fosters communication between international students, migrants, travelers and locals through the platforms of food, language and events.

**Project Audience**<br>
* International Students
* Migrants
* Locals
* Travelers

**How Our Idea is Different From/Improves Other Current Offerings**<br>
Currently, there is no existing mobile apps that are enables users to exchange  both local and international cultures. However, there the most similar app to InterX is [Withlocals](https://www.withlocals.com). This app enables travelers to connect with a travel host that acts as their tour guide. Withlocals is a peer-to-peer marketplace where locals offer experiences and skills to travelers. The app connects people and cultures through food and unique experiences. <br>

Our app differs from [Withlocals](https://www.withlocals.com) since it is primarily focused on international students and migrants wanting to connect to their local people/cultures, while learning international cultures simultaneously. Our app also focuses on three main platforms that users can choose from, such as food, language and events. With InterX, amplified diversity will be created amongst users - regardless being an international or local individual.

**Team Principles and Processes** <br>
The team will be committed to principles that maximize potential to learn and grow, while also ensuring that a product will be delivered that will be of the highest quality that each member can output.

**Principle**<br>
The team will foster an environment where feedback can be given and received by all members.  This feedback will have to fall into the realms of: 
* Positive specific (i.e. A compliment about a specific paragraph)
* Positive general (i.e. A remark about how a team member is very attentive and receptive to the group chat)
* Negative specific (i.e. I think this sentence can be written better, and should flow like...). 

**Rationale** <br>
All feedback should be a taken as an attempt to foster team spirit and to deliver on the highest quality of product possible.  It is important to the team to specify these attributes and attitudes to feedback delivery, feedback enables us to grow and to deliver a great product, and is a powerful tool when defined with the above constraints.<br>

The team will also be committed to an environment of innovation and developing the unique talents of each individual team member. This will be achieved by allowing team members to select the work that speaks most to them, and to allow themselves to take a genuine interest in the work they are participating in, and allow development based on the investment in their choice.  In adopting this principle, we believe that this will create an environment where every member is invested in delivering the best contribution they can to the project. 

**Operational Processes** <br>
To achieve the principles we have outlined above, it is expected that all team members will follow basic courtesy and etiquette rules. <br>
 
One of them will be to allow an attitude of open feedback, it will be the responsibility of the team members to make sure that feedback delivered fits into one of the categories of: positive specific, positive general or negative specific.  The danger lies within the ‘negative general’ feedback category, this piece of feedback will likely not be specific enough to be helpful, and will likely work against fostering team spirit.  If a team member is unsure of which category the feedback falls into, they should discuss it with an unrelated team member, who can assist them in confirming it falls into one of the three acceptable categories.<br>

To foster an environment of innovation, work will be broken up into segments, dubbed as tasks. Tasks will be available for team members to choose from, with each team member required to select a specific number of tasks.  If two team members wish to select the same task, it will be solved by a coin toss.  

**Task Division** <br>
Tasks will be allocated as fairly as possible, through discussion within the group. Work will be allocated first by volunteering then via group discussion. When allocating work, deadline and standard required will be clearly defined. All members will contribute equally to the project workload. Any group members who are unsatisfied with the allocation should raise it in a group meeting. Group members are expected to do their best to deliver tasks on time, and should contact the group in advance if they anticipate being unable to do so.

**Decision Making** <br>
Decisions will be made collectively as a group ensuring every team member’s ideas are taken into account. In case of discrepancies, the decision will be based on a voting system; in the case of a any disputes in voting, we will consult with the tutors or the course coordinator to assist with any problematic decision.

**Non-Compliance**<br>
**Minor non-compliance will be defined where:**
* A team member does not abide to the document standards set out by the team. (style guide will be decided upon before tasks are designated).
* A team member does not update team-coordinating software when an update on a task’s status has been changed (i.e. not moving a task on Trello).
* A team member does not inform the team of their planned/unplanned absence in a team meeting at least 3 hours before the meeting.  (via Facebook Messenger, Slack, email, etc.)

**Major non-compliance will be defined where:**
* A team member does not respond to assessment specific communication in one day.  (If a question is asked about progress, etc.)
* A team member does not fulfil their contribution to assessment specific tasks at the due date, or a date agreed upon by all team members.
* A team member does not prioritize attendance at team meetings, and is consistently absent from team meetings.
 
**Dispute resolution** <br> 
Any group member who takes issue with the actions of another group member should raise it either with the person in question, or at a group meeting, as appropriate. If these measures are unable to resolve it, only then it should be raised, by the group, with a tutor or lecturer. See also rules for peer assessment in the course profile (email co-ordinator, group notification/meeting, peer assessment).


## Communication
### Meetings
* Our team will meet once a week on a Friday (outside our workshop session) at 5 pm at The University of Queensland.

### File Storage
* Files will be stored under a Google Drive folder, currently named 'Team Multitalented' and a Github repository named Team Multi-talented.
* All files will follow a naming convention and the structure is as follows: DocumentName_GroupName_CourseCode.FileType

### Task Management
* Trello will be used to keep fellow team members on track of the project. Tasks will be uploaded to Trello, and team members will indicate which task they are working on and when. 

### Social Platform 
* Slack: All team members are in the #teammultitalented channel, all communications and discussions will happen there. 
* Facebook: This will be the second option of communication if Slack is not working or any of the members is not responding.
* Trello: Trello will enable easy and mobile task allocations via the Trello App.

## Project Phases 
### Research 
Before actually developing an app, we need have a deep understanding of our chosen domain and idea. Our research will include the current existing similar product in order to perform a UX comparison evaluation. 	This will enable us get an idea as to how to improve our app not only in terms of design, but functionality for users. This research is not only limited to requirements gathering from the internet, but from users via survey and paper prototyping. 

### Requirements
Below are methods in achieving requirements for our app: <br>

**Internet Research** <br>
The internet is the largest portal that enables us to research deeply about this app’s domain and idea, while allowing us to gather information about similar products. <br><br>
**User Survey** <br>
We will upload online surveys via Google Forms for our target audience; from where we can collect and analyze results in order to achieve a more specific set of requirements. <br><br>
**User Testing** <br>
User testing is vital. This is because it enables us to understand how to create an excellent user experience while also providing great usability for our users. By performing this test, we will be be able to improve our user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) based on the result of test upon analyzation. 

### Design
During the design stage, we will develop digital mockups which will then be used for user testing. From the results of the test, we will finalize our app mockup that will be used as a guide for the actual construction of the app prototype. 

### Construction
At this stage, we are planning to develop our app prototype using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If any back-end development is needed, PHP and SQL will be integrated. Each feature of the app will be tested, reiterated and finalized based on feedback.
