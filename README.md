### How To Use It 
#### Profile Builder 
1. https://cultureconnect.uqcloud.net/
2. Choose a user persona from the sign in section (page header). 
3. A profile builder pop-up modal will display. 
4. Your homepage will be personalized based on the answers you selected from the profile builder.
5. Scroll down and you will see a section that says 'Because you like..'. 
6. Choose and click any of them. It will direct you to the event details.
7. The section as aforementioned is tailored to your liking.
8. This is done to house an enhanced personalized experience for users. 
9. This feature has been presented as a viable prototype to future release.
10. Profile Builder in final release should save to either an XML data file or direct to a database. 
11. Profile Builder shoud consist of more constraints, collecting a wider array of personal information which is relevant to the user. An example would be to consider mobile-first development with supporting native functions related to location services. User's should be asked to provide permissions to location services or asked to provide a suburb of residence to display event recommendations.

**Note:** If the profile builder has launced already for that user, you must close the browser for it to launch again!

#### Event e-invitation 
1. Head to https://cultureconnect.uqcloud.net/

## Summary 
### Problem Space
When international students move to study abroad, it's only common for them to feel homesick. Not only that, finding new friends and socializing could be tricky. The culture gap could affect them in feeling lonely and out of place. It could also be difficult for them to adapt to the new culture. 

### Solution
With CultureConnect, we aim to make international students feel connected to their home while also learning about/adapting to different cultures easier. It is a platform that will connect international students in Brisbane to find multicultural events and happenings around them. In these events, there will also be an event chat space for them to meet new people online and socialize before meeting in real life at the day of the event itself. The event listings will be generated based on userâ€™s institution (Based on the latest user testing and to test the demographic, we choose University of Queensland as a fixed institution for the prorotype), Brisbane-wide location and the most popular events based on the quantity of participants.

## Process
### Research
We have conducted research that can be found ![here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-students-information-seeking) and ![here](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-students-interaction-behavior-with-social-media) and surveys such as ![User Demographic Survey](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/User-Demographic-Survey) and ![International Student Survey](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/International-Student-Survey).

### Requirements
Based on research and survey results, we found that international students often connect to their own culture by socializing with among the same ethnic. Not only that, the the top 5 problems the international student are facing is shown as the following:

* Language barrier
* Being far from their support network
* Homesickness
* Feeling like an outsider
* Making friends

To better understand that problem, we designed this prototype and our aim is to enable international students to connect to their own culture and other cultures by joining cultural events and same-interest communities in hopes that language barrier, homesickness, the feeling of being an outsider can be reduced and the process of making friends for them would be easier.

### Design
Don Norman's design principles were used to ensure usability of our app along with the interactive design process for ensuring our prototype meets our usability and UX goals as well as fulfilling our user requirements. Initially, the prototype was an mobile app. However, through feedbacks from users, we have changed it to a web application instead. 

We made a ![low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/Low-Fidelity-Prototype) to test if users could understand the purpose and concept of the project. Based on the ![user testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/team-multi-talented/wiki/Usability-Testing-&-Findings), we have collated, reviewed and analyzed the results. Then, together with the results from our research and survey as aforementioned, we created a set of requirements for our prototype and created a product backlog on Trello: https://trello.com/b/CeRxugZ5/deco3500-culture-connect.

The prototype is as shown below:

### Construction 
CultureConnect was built in phases (sprints) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Through each iteration, ensuring a user-centered, concrete, and cross-cultural design approach was crucial for this app's success. We've performed user testing with international students who have been providing valuable feedback and testing information. The collected data helped in understanding the user's conceptual models and mental models. Hence, enabling us to make changes in our project's requirements in order to improve not only usability, but UX of our project.

#### Relevant Theories 
* **Emotional Design**<br>
Since our app is targetting international students, it is essential that they feel connected to their own culture and are able to experience other cultures through our website. We want our users to experience positivity (such as pleasure, trust, security) when they use our website. This was curated by developing a UI/UX that feels enjoyable, safe and emotionally beneficial for them. Ultimately, a deep attachment or bond between users and CultureConnect could exist.

*  **Awareness**<br>
Users are able to view upcoming cultural events in their area and that are tailored to their interests. They also have the option to register for an event and communicate to other users who are interested in the same event in the event chat space. 

* **Collaboration**<br>
Ideally, the rich content in our website is mostly user-generated - they are able to host their own cultural event and join others. Through our website, they are also able to socialize, meet new people and meet up during event happenings.
